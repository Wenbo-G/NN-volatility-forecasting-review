Authors,"Sarat Chandra Nayak, Bijan Bihari Misra"
Year,2020
Journal,Financial Innovation
Aim,Proposes extreme learning machine with chemical reaction optimisation (ELCRO) based forecasting for financial time series
Main methods,Uses CRO (an evolutionary algorithm) as a pretraining method for ELM
Benchmark methods,"PSO-ELM, GA-ELM, GD_ELM"
Method overview,The weights from the ELM are pretrained with CRO. A grid search was done
Method complexity,"6 inputs, 16 hidden neurons"
Volatility definition,"Standard deviation of logged returns, with N = number of days before nearest expiry date"
Data summary,Daily closing price of BSE from Apr 2 2012 to Nov 24 2017 (1400 points)
System in,"I guess time lagged inputs, not sure if returns or volatility"
System out,1 day ahead volatility prediction. And 1 day ahead price prediction
Results summary,ELCRO best wrt MAPE and ARV obtained with 5-14 neuron system. Also the best at price prediction wrt MAPE and ARV. The statistical tests say the same thing
Performance metric,"MAPE, ARV. Also Wilcoxon signed rank and Diebold Mariano test"
Evaluation method,"950 points for training, 450 points for testing, 1 day ahead volatility prediction. Average of 20 repetitions considered"
Open source?,na
Code language?,MATLAB
Interesting notes,
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Okay, nothing special. Just ELM with some random optimisation method"
