Journal,Expert Systems with Applications
Aim,To build a more flexible model
Main methods,Stacked ANN
Benchmark methods,"ANN, ANN-GARCH, ANN-EGARCH, Heston model"
Method overview,"Several methods used to optimise stacked ANN parameters: MMSE, CBB, SB, MEB, HCV. Which one to use is found through grid search tested against 50% of the data. The stacked ANN uses RF, Gradient Boosting trees (GB), and SVMs."
Method complexity,"2 hidden layers, 20 and 10 neurons"
Volatility definition,"True realised volatility, i.e., standard deviation of log returns with a time window of 5"
Data summary,"S&P volatilies observed in 7 year periods starting in: 2000,2001,2002,2009,2010. So from 2000 to 2018"
System in,"Last 30 volatilies computed with returns observed in the market, scaled [0,1], along with forecasts from the RF, GB, SVMs. The RF, GB, and SVM is given the last 30 volatilies too as prediction"
System out,"I think, next step ahead volatility forecast, i.e. volatility for the next 5 days"
Results summary,"Regardless of period, the Stacked ANN outperforms hybrid models based on autoregressive methods, like ANN-GARCH and ANN-EGARCH. Stacked ANN with student t distribution is the only model that produces appropriate p-values for the VaR and Cvar tests"
Performance metric,"VaR and CVaR, along with 4 tests for these"
Evaluation method,"25% to fit first level algorithms, 50% to ANN estimate, 25% test set, and the following year as out of sample forecasting. The models were trained and test 5 times, with S&P500 volatilies observed in 7 year periods starting in: 2000,2001,2002,2009,2010. The year after the 7th year was out of sample testing, i.e., 2008, 2009, etc..."

Interesting notes,"It has been suggested (with reference) to use one day lagged inputs for NNs
They mention that they used out of sample error to choose best model, but I think that is misphrased and they mean to say the 50% of data used"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Okay. Stacked ANN isn't really a thing, and uses VaR"
