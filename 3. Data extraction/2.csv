Aim,To introduce a hybrid model integrating variational mode decomposition (VMD) and a bidirectional neural network model and to show the efficacy of VMD methods in combination with NN methods
Main methods,"VMD and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), using a divide and ensemble approach"
Benchmark methods,GRU and BiGRU
Method overview,"Divides the signal into many components, each of which is forecasted and aggregated (which is done inherently in the BiGRU model)"
Method complexity,"4 hidden layers (input,forward,backward,output) and 1 fully connected layer. Number of nodes in each hidden layer equal to the input dimension"
Volatility definition,Historical volatility on the daily logged returns on closing price
Data summary,"Natural rubber futures index, RUL9 on the shanghai futures exchange (SHFE) daily data (high, low, open, close, volume). 3047 data points (Jan 4th 2006 to Jul 15th 2018)"
System in,"Open close high low volume of underlying asset. Also, the decomposed modes of the target variable (closing price and 7 day volatility). Reorganised as a 7 day loop time window from t-7 to t-1. 0-1 normalisation applied to both the price and volatility data I think"
System out,Daily closing price and 7 day realised volatility of logged returns of closing price
Results summary,VMD BiGRU was better than both GRU and BiGRU in terms of error measures and directional prediction
Performance metric,"RMSE, MAPE, $R^2$ for the prediction ability. Directional accuracy (DA, ability to predict movement of direction) also used"
Evaluation method,"85% training (2591 data points), 15% testing (456 data points). Continuous training and test applied using a rolling time window of 180 days, i.e., first all training points are used to predict the next 180 day period in intervals of 7 days, then shift everything back 180s and restart. (unclear). Every 7 successive days of trading data were taken as the input for the model to forecast the next one, i.e., from x1 to x7, y8 is forecasted"

Interesting notes,"The definition of volatility is from day 1, so unsure if they did next day forecasting or next period (7day) forecasting
Using decomposed time series from VMD, in addition to the original time series allowed for better predictive ability, using a divide and ensemble approach (decompose the signal into different aspects, use different models for different aspects, aggregate the outputs of all models)"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)",Okay
Insights/my takeaway,"They also include summary statistics of the volatility and the underlying closing price, as mean, SD,kewness, kurtosis, Jarque-Bera test, and augmented dicky fuller test. It showed the daily closing price is unstationary due to unit root, and indicates that the 7 day volatility rejects the null hypothesis. Jarque Bera showed rejection from normality of daily closing price and 7 day volatility"
