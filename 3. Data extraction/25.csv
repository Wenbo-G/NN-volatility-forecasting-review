Title,Gold volatility prediction using a CNN-LSTM approach
Authors,"Andres Vidal, Werner Kristjanpoller"
Year,2020
Journal,Expert Systems with Applications
Aim,To generate better prediction of the future
Main methods,CNN-LSTM
Benchmark methods,"GARCH, SVR, LSTM, CNN, ANN, and GARCH-ANN"
Method overview,"Time series information converted to RGB images through Gramian Angular Fields and Markov Transition Fields, constructed from a number of lags in the series, processed with a pre-trained CNN (VGG16) to extract features, combined with an LSTM that takes in lagged return series to create another embedding, then a final layer generates volatility forecasts by combining the features from the CNN and the embedding from the LSTM"
Method complexity,"VGG16 (huge) with 4 extra layers to reduce dimensionality, and LSTM with 2 layers and a final 200 dimensional embedding"
Volatility definition,Variance of log return in a 14 days into the future
Data summary,"Daily spot price of gold from April 1968 to October 2017 (12530 trading days), converted to a log return series"
System in,"(I think) the LSTM takes in 3 lags of the returns, along with the CNN taking in images"
System out,Variance of log return in a 14 days into the future
Results summary,"Many different parameterisations of the benchmark models were done, however the proposed CNN-LSTM was best, shown to be superior to all of the by the MCS"
Performance metric,Model Confidence Set MCS. Also MSE
Evaluation method,"80% training, 20% testing."
