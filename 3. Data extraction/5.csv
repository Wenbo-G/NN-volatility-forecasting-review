Aim,Proposes a new ANFIS which adaptively adjusts fuzzy inference rules by using fruit fly optimisation algorithm
Main methods,Adaptive network based fuzzy inference (ANFIS) with adaptively adjusted fuzzy inference rules through fruit fly optimisation algorithm (FOA)
Benchmark methods,na
Method overview,as suggested
Method complexity,na
Volatility definition,Historical volatility on logged returns of the month
Data summary,"Shanghai A-share sample stocks: 600827.SH, 600115.SH, 600018.SH, from Jan 2006 to Jul 2016. PCA was also used to transform the data"
System in,"Macroeconomic: close, high, low, volume, range of daily fluctuations, swing, P/E ratio, price/book ratio, price/sa;es, price cash flow ratio, dividend yield ratio of Shanghai stock exchange composite index
Microeconomic: close,high,low,volume, range of daily fluctuations, swing, p/e ratio, price to book ratio, price to sales, price cash flow ratio, dividend yield ratio, BOLL, BIAS, DMA, EXPMA, MACD, RSI, KDJ, stage high, stage low, up days, down days of sample stocks
PCA transformed the aforementioned data, number of components not specified"
System out,Monthly volatility of log returns
Results summary,FOA-ANFIS performed better than ANFIS
Performance metric,Error (just straight up difference)
Evaluation method,"Very unclear to tell, but a picture seems to indicate that there was some kind of test set, which may indicate out-of-sample testing. It seems like only a single month was tested on"
