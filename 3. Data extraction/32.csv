Aim,To apply LSTM deep learning algorithm to financial market in order to predict the trend of values of stock indices and their volatilities
Main methods,LSTM
Benchmark methods,na
Method overview,"Technical indicators: MA, EMA, momentum (M = S_t - S_[t-m]), hybrid momentum (HM = S_t - MA(S_[t-m],p)). Given this, the LSTM takes in 3 sets of inputs, and outputs 3 sets of outputs. In addition to one step ahead forecasting of volatility, I think they also do directional prediction"
Method complexity,na
Volatility definition,Standard deviation of the underlying asset prices
Data summary,"S&P500, NASDAQ, German DAX, Korean KOSPI200, Mexico IPCover. High, low, open, close, volume, for a 7 year period from Apr 1 2010 to Dec 30 2016."
System in,"1: volatility 6: volatility, open, high, low, volume, returns. 12: the previous with MA(m1), MA(m2), MA(m3), EMA(m1), EMA(m2), EMA(m3)"
System out,"Volatility OR momentum OR hybrid momentum, as regression or classification (direction)"
Results summary,"The true positive rates do not seem to be dependent upon the number of features and the classification with only 1 feature results in better rates than with 6 or 12 in some cases. Predictions based on momentum and hybrid momentum have lower errors that value of mean averages, and 1 input feature was generally best"
Performance metric,"MSE, MAPE. Also true positive rate"
Evaluation method,Training data partition into K equal sized buckets based on the quantities in each interval
Open source?,na
Code language?,na
Interesting notes,"This paper also tries to predict stock price itself. In this case, everything above is replaced, from volatility to stock price"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)",Bad. Doesn't even use variance of return series as volatility. Is hard to follow
Insights/my takeaway,
VD,Historical volatility (of stock price)
MT,Pure
NT,RNN (LSTM)
HT,na
PT,na
EA,na
pEA,na
IN,
IS,"Single asset, univariate (volatility), multivariate (volatility, open, high, low, volume, returns, MA(m1), MA(m2), MA(m3), EMA(m1), EMA(m2), EMA(m3))"
IW,all (unsure)
OW,unsure
SFP,unsure
EM,"MSE, MAPE, TPR"
