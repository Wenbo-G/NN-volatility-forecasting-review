Aim,"To explore the usefulness of the VMD in extracting economic and financial time series features for prediction. Particularly, to compare EMD and VMD"
Main methods,VMD in combination with general regression NN (GRNN)
Benchmark methods,"EMD with GRNN, feedforward NN (trained on past 5 observations) and ARMA"
Method overview,"VMD requires parameter k number of decompositions. This was defined as the number of IMFs obtained from EMD, then in the range of +-3"
Method complexity,"4 layers, though its hard to compare as its not well defined"
Volatility definition,VIX
Data summary,CBOE NASDAQ100 volatility index (VIX) daily data from 2nd Jan 2008 to 16th Dec 2013
System in,"Intrinsic mode functions (IMF) of price signal (I think, no mention of normalisation etc...)"
System out,"VIX value. Note that although this doesn't predict volatility of some asset, it predicts VIX, which I thought was good enough"
Results summary,VMD-GRNN with all values of k outperforms every benchmark for all metrics
Performance metric,"MAE, MAPE, RMSE"
Evaluation method,"80% of samples for training, other 20% for testing"

Interesting notes,"EMD can represent nonlinear nonstationary signals without the need of a basis function (like Fourier or Wavelet) and is therefore data driven and self adaptive
Variational EMD (VMD) was introduced as EMD lacked exact mathematical modelling, was sensitive to noise and sampling and interpolation choice
Apparently feedforward NN trained on past 5 observations works"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Okay, although it predicts VIX, the methods are interesting and could be useful for later work"
Insights/my takeaway,"EMD can represent nonlinear nonstationary signals without the need of a basis function (like Fourier or Wavelet) and is therefore data driven and self adaptive
Variational EMD (VMD) was introduced as EMD lacked exact mathematical modelling, was sensitive to noise and sampling and interpolation choice
Apparently feedforward NN trained on past 5 observations works"
