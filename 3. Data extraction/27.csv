Aim,Employ BSd in order to achieve a more accurate predicting RNN model
Main methods,BSd-RNN
Benchmark methods,"DWT-FFNN, Haar-RNN, dbn-RNN, GARCH, ARIMA"
Method overview,"The original time series is preprocessed with BSd (d=1,2,3, or 4). Then, all decomposed data is fed as inputs to RNN"
Method complexity,na
Volatility definition,"Monthly volatility time series, of log price return, for 22 days (a trading month)"
Data summary,"Daily closing prices of S&P500, NASDAQ, DIJA, NYSE, from the period Jun 11 2000, to Jun 11 2019 (about 5000 samples)"
System in,"Many lagged variables (unsure), such as 3 lagged volatilities, previous lagged estimate of volatility, lagged returns, then lagged conditional average"
System out,Next step ahead volatility forecast
Results summary,"BSd-RNN models almost all superior to other models, with d=3, across all indices. Additionally, RNN had better performance than FFNN"
Performance metric,"FRMSE, FMAE, FMAPE"
Evaluation method,"80% training, 15% test, 5% out of sample forecast"
Open source?,na
Code language?,Matlab
Interesting notes,"B-spline wavelet of order d (BSd) is defined as a local discrete wavelet transform. With d=1, it is Haar wavelet transform with discontinuous wavelets, with d>2 its smooth wavelets.
One note is that they say high-frequency data, but daily data probably doesn't count as high frequency data"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)",Good. It's interesting and may be useful later.
