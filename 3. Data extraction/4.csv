Aim,Propose a neural network reformulation of stochastic volatility by leveraging stochastic models and RNNs
Main methods,"NSVM: Network (autoregressive RNN and bidirectional RNN) to model a latent stochastic variable inferred from observation, then another network (pair of RNN and an MLP) to predict volatility from the sequence of latent variables"
Benchmark methods,"Quadratic models ARCH(1), GARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1,1) 
Absolute value models AVARCH(1), AVGARCH(1,1), TARCH(1,1,1)
Exponential models EARCH(1), EGARCH(1,1)
MCMC volatility model: stochvol
Gaussian process volatility model GP-Vol"
Method overview,"During training, a single model is trained on each time step for all the training samples. During testing, retraining occurs every 20 steps. Additionally, all baselines are retrained every time step.
Additionally, 2 types of covariance configurations, diagonal, and diagonal with rank 1 perturbation"
Method complexity,"Each RNN module contains 1 hidden layer of size 10, the MLP is 2 layer fully connected hidden layer size 10, output layer of MLP is 8 and 12"
Volatility definition,Historical volatility (unsure) on logged returns
Data summary,"Daily closing prices of 162 stocks, Chinas A shares starting from 2006 or earlier, cleaned by aligning mismatched values, interpolating missing values through stochastic regression. Sets of 6 series were combined to create one timeseries input, 2000 of these were used. The total length of each 6-dimensional time series was 2570 samples (roughly 7 years)"
System in,Normalised log returns (xt = log(pt/pt-1))
System out,"Unclear, but I think it's realized volatility of logged returns, but not sure over what time window"
Results summary,"NSVM with rank 1 perturbation achieved higher accuracy over all baselines for all 162 stocks. Additionally, seems to be more sensible on drastic changes and better stability on moderate changes"
Performance metric,Negative log likelihood
Evaluation method,"2000 time steps for training and validation, 570 time steps for testing"
Open source?,na

Interesting notes,Fundamentally from stochastic differential equations
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Good, for stochastic models and stochastic differential equations"
Insights/my takeaway,"When choosing the time series data, consideration was given to suspension days. I should probably do this too"
