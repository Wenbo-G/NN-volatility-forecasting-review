Aim,"A unifying approach of using dynamic neural networks (DNNs) for predicting stock market prices and volatility, forecasting chaotic stock price indices and volatility from one day ahead to one month ahead"
Main methods,Hybrid DNN and differential evolution (DE) for learning parameters with CEFLANN: DEDNNFLANN
Benchmark methods,"DNNFLANN, GARCH"
Method overview,"Computationally efficient FLANN, where each input is expanded through a set of nonlinear functions. Sliding mode learning algorithm, formulating error in such a way that given an arbitrary initial condition, the learning error will converge to 0. DE is used to initialise the network"
Method complexity,"14 IIR filter neurons, 7 FLANN functions, 56 FLANN parameters"
Volatility definition,"Moving average of squared difference between the log return and its mean value (i.e., population variance of log returns, current volatility is a function of current return and 4 past returns)"
Data summary,"Daily close prices of Nifty and RIL, from 3rd Jan 2005 to 18th Oct 2007"
System in,"Past 5 days of variance and log price returns (I think), scaled to range (0,1). Also technical indicators SMA, EMA, MACD"
System out,"Next day ahead volatility prediction, and 1 week ahead, and more"
Results summary,"The proposed method (DEDNNFLANN) performs better than GARCH, for all time horizons"
Performance metric,"ME, MAE, RMSE"
Evaluation method,Training: 500 points from 3rd Jan 2005 to 28th Dec 2006. Testing: 200 points from 29th Dec 2006 to 18th Oct 2007
