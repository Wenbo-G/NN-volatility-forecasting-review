Title,Exploiting the low risk anomaly using machine learning to enhance the Black Litterman framework: evidence from south Korea
Authors,"Sujin Pyo, Jaewook Lee"
Year,2018
Journal,Pacfic-Basin Finance Journal
Aim,Select from 3 models to predict volatility to construct a black litterman portfolio and compare with the CAPM portfolio
Main methods,"Gaussian process regression, support vector regression, ANN, GARCH"
Benchmark methods,Average of previous squared returns over past 60 days
Method overview,"KOSPI200, 60 monthly volatilies for 5 years as training data, and predicted one volatility next month using 10 past monthly volatilities as inputs. The period of investment is 2005 to 2016"
Method complexity,na
Volatility definition,"undefined, but probably just realised volatility, i.e., standard deviation"
Data summary,"60 monthly volatilies for 5 years as training data, and predicted one volatility next month using 10 past monthly volatilities as inputs"
System in,10 past monthly volatilities
System out,realised volatility for next month
Results summary,"SVR and ANN better than GARCH, GPR was worst. ANN showed a similar average to benchmark, but was more stable. Therefore ANN is best"
Performance metric,"MAPE, MAE, RMSE"
Evaluation method,Out of sample prediction on next month volatility based on prev 10 months
Open source?,na
Code language?,na
Interesting notes,"The main purpose of this paper is not volatility prediction, but rather portfolio construction. Therefore, the emphasis is not on volatility prediction"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Bad, emphasis on portfolio construction rather than volatility prediction"
