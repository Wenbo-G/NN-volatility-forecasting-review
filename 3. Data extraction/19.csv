Aim,To investigate the effect of good and bad news of volatility in the Hungary stock market. To examine whether potentially nonlinear neural networks out perform latest statistical methods
Main methods,Gaussian activation function radial basis function neural network with error correct mechanism (GRBFNN)
Benchmark methods,"SVR, ARIMA (1,1,0), EGARCH(1,1) GED, soft GRBFNN"
Method overview,"First, statistical methods (GARCH, PGARCH, EGARCH) were compared to find the best ones based on AIC, LL, and which error distribution through Generalized errors distribution (GED)"
Method complexity,"1 hidden layer, 3 to 10 hidden neurons, with I think k=p+q inputs, where p and q = 1, so k = 2?"
Volatility definition,"I think historical volatility on logged returns, i.e., standard deviation of logged price differences"
Data summary,"BUX stocks for Jan 7th 2004 to Dec 21 2012 (2256 observations), converted to log return series"
System in,"Unsure, but I think past two log returns (k=p+q=2)"
System out,I guess next day volatility prediction
Results summary,"GRBFNN with error correction was best, followed by SVR then soft GRBFNN"
Performance metric,"MAPE, RMSE"
Evaluation method,"Pre GFC was training set (Jan 2004 to Jun 2007), and post GFC was test set (Jul 2007 to Dec 2012). Results of the best configuration was stated"

Interesting notes,"The time series was nonstationary, but the return series was
The thought of this proposal is based on the economic theory of the co-integrated variables which are related to an error-correction model. The simple mean equation (1) can be interpreted as long-run relationship that hold among the k = p + q input variables to y when the system is in equilibrium"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Bad, so many missing details in implementation"
