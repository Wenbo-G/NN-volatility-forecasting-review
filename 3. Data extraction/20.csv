Journal,Expert Systems with Applications
Aim,"Proposes a hybrid LSTM model with multiple GARCH type models: EWMA, GARCH, and EGARCH"
Main methods,GEW-LSTM
Benchmark methods,"GARCH, EGARCH, EWMA, as singles and combined with LSTM and deep FNN, and single, double hybrids of them"
Method overview,"ARCH type models compared, then single hybrids, then double hybrids, then compared to the proposed triple hybrid"
Method complexity,"DFN with 3 hidden layers 10-5-1, and LSTMs with 5 hidden layers 10-4-2-5-1"
Volatility definition,Historical volatility of log returns. Standard deviation of log price differences over a given window of time
Data summary,"KOSPI200: training: 2665 data points from Jan 1 2001 to Sept 30 2011, and testing: 1298 points until Jan 2 2017. Also 3 year Korea Treasury Bond interest rate, 3 year AA grade corporate bond, daily close price of Gold and Crude Oil, all for the same period. Everything converted to return series by taking log differences"
System in,"Previous 22 trading days of explanatory variables: KOSPI200 index, KOSPI200index log difference return rate, time of KOSPI200 index log difference return rate at -1 time, 3 year KTB interest rate, interest rate for 3 year AA grade CB, price of crude oil and gold. As well as parameters from the GARCH, EGARCH. EWMA models for the previous 22 trading days"
System out,Next day ahead volatility prediction
Results summary,"GEW-LSTM performs best in all cases, for all metrics, for all time windows, for all days ahead"
Performance metric,"MAE, MSE, HMAE, HMSE. Also Wilcoxon signed rank test and Diebold Mariano test"
Evaluation method,"20% of training set was used as validation for NN models. 1 day ahead prediction. Additionally, 14 and 21 day ahead prediction made. Additionally, 7 and 15 day lagged inputs (window) used."

Interesting notes,"Volatility clustering is the phenomenon where high volatility is maintained to some extent, and low volatility is maintained to some extent (Mandelbrot 1967)
Provides a good history of realised volatility and how it came about"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)",Good
Insights/my takeaway,"This paper does a good summary statistics of the data, I should do something similar to them"
