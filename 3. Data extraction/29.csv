Aim,Propose an autoregressive distribution regression framework called parsimonious autoregressive multistep density regression (PA-MS-DR)
Main methods,PA-MS-DR
Benchmark methods,"8 different GARCH models, with MS-DR (the non-autoregressive version)"
Method overview,"L = {20,40,60}, neurons units augmented ReLU = max(0.1,x). Uses GRUs to extract information from past time steps and predict distribution parameters of the PDF"
Method complexity,"Hidden units = {1,4,8,16}"
Volatility definition,Historical volatility (unsure) of log returns
Data summary,"S&P500, NASDAQ100, Nikkei225 from Jan 1995 to Feb 2019, transformed into log returns"
System in,"L x 4, where the 4 represents the return series from 1st to 4th power"
System out,Volatility each day for 5 days in the future
Results summary,"PA-MS-DR fit the data better (lower NLL). Under t-distribution assumption of asset returns, PA-MS-DR outperforms, with MS-DR in second. With normal distribution assumption, same thing . The t-distribution assumption performed better"
Performance metric,Average of negative log likelihood (NLL) for the next 5 days prediction. Also Christophersen's independence test and Kupiec's proportion of failures coverage test
Evaluation method,"Training set contains first nine tenths (90%) of the original time series, and the validation set and testing set each contain one twentieth of the original time series (5%). Model fit evaluated by overfitting and looking at negative log likelihood"
Open source?,na
Code language?,na
Interesting notes,"They apparently invest a novel approximate back propagation through time algorithm for the model PA-MS-DR and its convergence is proved
GARCH, and this method, assumes dependent variable y follows certain known family of distributions"
"Subjective quality (bad, okay, good)","Good. A bit convoluted but interesting. Strong change from the other papers, and could draw some good ideas from this. Maybe also worth to implement this as benchmark"
